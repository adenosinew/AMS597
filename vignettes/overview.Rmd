## Introduction

This package is based on Professor Kuan's paper^[A Simple and Robust Method for Partially Matched Samples Using the P-Values Pooling Approach, 2013].

It provided a statistical analyses in scenarios where some samples from the matched pairs design are missing, resulting in partially matched samples. 

## Package Info 

This package could process 5 procedures:

- modified t-statistic of Kim et al.
- corrected Z-test of Looney and Jones
- MLE based test of Ekbohm under homoscedasticity
- MLE based test of Lin and Stivers under heteroscedasticity
- weighted Z-test combination

## Arguments
### data
data is a **data frame** have two columns, the first column is tumor data and the second colum is normal data. **NA** values for missing data.

### var.equal
For MLE based procedure, if `var.equal=T` will process homo- case and `var.equal=F` will process heteroscedasticity case.

## Formulas & Usages
### Modified t-statistic of Kim et al.
The modified t-statistic $t_3$ of Kim et al.^[Kim B, Kim I, Lee S, Kim S, Rha S, Chung H. Statistical methods of translating microarray data into clinically relevant diagnostic information in colorectal cancer. Bioinformatics. 2004; 21(4): 517–528. [PubMed: 15374865]] takes the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
 t_3=\frac{{n_1}\bar{D}+{n_H}(\bar{T}-\bar{N})}{\sqrt{{n_1}{S_D}^2+{n_H}^2(S_N^2/n_3+S_T^2/n_2)}}
\end{aligned}
$$
And the null distribution of $t_3$ is approcimated with a standard Gaussian distribution.

One can call this function in the package e.g. `modTstat(data, alternative="less")`.

### Corrected Z-test of Looney and Jones
The corrected Z-test of Looney and Jones^[ Looney S, Jones P. A method for comparing two normal means using combined samples of correlated and uncorrelated data. Statistics in Medicine. 2003; 22:1601–1610.] is based on a modified variance estimation of the standard Z-test by accounting for the correlation among the $n_1$ matched pairs,
$$
\begin{aligned}
 Z_{corr}=\frac{\bar{T^*}-\bar{N^*}}{\sqrt{S_T^{*2}/(n_1+n_2)+S_N^{*2}/(n_1+n_3)-2n_1S_{TN_1}/(n_1+n_2)(n_1+n_3)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

e.g. `corrZtest(data, alternative="less")`

### MLE based test

There are two kinds of MLE based test. The first is proposed by Ekbohm^[ Ekbohm G. On comparing means in the paired case with incomplete data on both responses. Biometrika. 1976;63(2):299–304. ] and the second is proposed by Lin and Stivers^[ Lin P, Stivers L. On differences of means with incomplete data. Biometrika. 1974; 61(2):325–334. ].

Both MLE based test under homo- or heteroscedasticity have similar form like this:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 Z_{LS}=\frac{f(\bar{T_1}-\bar{T})-g(\bar{N_1}-\bar{N})+\bar{T}-\bar{N}}{\sqrt{V_1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

e.g. `mle(data. var.equal=T)`

### Wighted Z-test Combination

The combined p-value by the weighted Z-test introduced by Liptak^[Liptak T. On the combination of independent tests. Magyar Tudom Aanyos Akad Aemia Matematikai Kutat Ao Intezetenek Kozlemenyei. 1958; 3:171–197. ] is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 p_{ci}=1-\Phi(\frac{w_1Z_{1i}+w_2Z_{2i}}{\sqrt{w_1^2+w_2^2}})
\end{aligned}
$$

e.g. `mle(data, alternative="two.sided")`
